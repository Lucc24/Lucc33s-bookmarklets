the 3d webpage one may be a little jank, works best with a mouse instead of a trackpad



the gimkit script only allows it to work AFTER you have gone through most or all of the questions, regardless of if you got them right or not.

for some reason, autoclicker bookmarklets dont work on cookie clicker

PLEASE let me know if any of these do not work, you can contact me on discord @lucc33 or through github.
